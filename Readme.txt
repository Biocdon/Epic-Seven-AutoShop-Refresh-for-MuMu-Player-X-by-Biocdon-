
Hello guys: This program is an E7 Secret Shop Macro and it was adapted to MuMu PlayerX resolution:1080x608 and it needs to be in the center of the screen 
(change the config in configuration center), if you want it to be exactly in the center easily simply click "mini-mode" to the left of the minimize button in MuMu.
-Make sure the buttons of MuMuPlayer are invisible because it may cause problems with image identification.
-You can change and adapt your own images in case your display is different and it isn't working.
For the app to start with the program without doing anything you need to use the following MuMuPlayer root:
-The app root is "C:\Program Files\MuMu9\emulator\nemu9\EmulatorShell\NemuPlayer.exe"
Instructions: 
-To start the program simply double click and make sure to run as administrator.
-FailSafe: (Exit) to exit simply position your mouse to the top right corner whilst holding "Q" button.
